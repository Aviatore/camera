# 1394 Digital Camera Image Grabber
The software allows performing basic operations on a CCD camera controlled by the 1394cmdr driver ([https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/index.html](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/index.html)), e.g. image preview, setting gain and shutter. Images captured by the software can be saved into TIF or BMP format. The program was created as a replacement for image processing software provided with the UVP Gel Imaging System because of a connectivity problem between a camera and the original software.
